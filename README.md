# Create Reagent App

Setup a ClojureScript/Reagent app in one command.  This is meant to be used like Create React App but with much less opinion and no need to "eject" from anything.

## Housekeeping

Install the following before moving onto the `Quickstart`

- [Install Java]
- [Install Clojure]

**Note:** This guides assumes you're using a minimum of Clojure CLI Tools version `1.10.1.697` or later!  This is why you see see newer args passed to `clj`. (At the time of this writing anyways October 15, 2020).  Not sure which version you have?  Run the following command:

```bash
clj -h
```

The first lines of the output will look _something_ like this:

```bash
➜ clj -h
Version: 1.10.2.796
# ..
```

## QuickStart

- Move to a directory where you want your ClojureScript app to live

- run `create-reagent-app`

  ```bash
  clj -Sdeps '{:deps
                {seancorfield/clj-new {:mvn/version "1.1.309"}}}' \
    -X clj-new/create \
    :template '"https://github.com/tkjone/create-reagent-app@7500dd43dc1be88a762ec2d74aad1f2c2c29842d"' \
    :name nike/fitness-app
  ```

The format of `:name` is `<org-name>/<app-name>`.  So in this case, if you were working for `nike`, you `org-name` would be `nike` and your `app-name` would be `fitness-app`.  See the [official clj-new docs] for more info on the args.

```bash
fitness-app
├── README.md
├── deps.edn
├── dev.cljs.edn
├── resources
│   └── public
│       ├── index.html
│       └── style.css
├── src
│   └── nike
│       └── fitness_app.cljs
└── test
    └── nike
        └── fitness_app_test.cljs
```

- Move into `fitness-app`

  ```bash
  cd fitness-app
  ```

- Run the app for development

  ```bash
  clj -M:dev
  ```

## Pro Tips

### Add a Global Alias

I used the verbose command in the [QuickStart] section for two reasons:

- An example of using `-X` with clj-new/create
- No additional configuration needed

Having said this, the best thing is to add a global `.clojure` alias.  To do this, follow these steps:

- Open your global `.clojure` directory

  ```bash
  atom ~/.clojure
  ```

  > Note that `atom` is _my_ editor.  If you're not using `atom`, replace `atom` with the CLI command for your editor of choice.  Or just open `~/.clojure` from inside of your editor.

- Add the following alias to the `deps.edn` file in `~/.clojure`

  ```clojure
  {:aliases
   {:create-reagent-app
    {:extra-deps {seancorfield/clj-new {:mvn/version "1.1.309"}}
     :ns-default clj-new
     :exec-args  {:template "https://github.com/tkjone/create-reagent-app@7500dd43dc1be88a762ec2d74aad1f2c2c29842d"}}}}
  ```

  > For a better understanding of what this file looks like you can look at [my dot-clojure] file.  In addition, if you want to see another example of what an amazing `dot-clojure` file looks like I highly encourage you to read and absorb [Sean Corfield's dot-clojure] file.

### Using The Global Alias

Assuming you have finished the [Add a Global Alias] step

- Move to a directory where you want your ClojureScript app to live

- Run the `create-reagent-app` alias:

  ```clj
  clj -X:create-reagent-app create :name nike/fitness-app
  ```

Much better, yes?

### Keeping aliases updated

Whenever this project updates, you will need to use the latest `hash` to take advantage of those changes.

- visit this repos [commit history]
- copy the latest `sha hash`
- replace the `sha hash` in your alias with the new `sha hash`

## Notes

The structure of `organization-name/project-name` is defined by `clj-new` and not this template.
